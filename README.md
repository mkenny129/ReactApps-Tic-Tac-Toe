# This code makes a tic-tac-toe game that:
# -Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
# -Indicates when a player has won the game,
# -Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
# -Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

# In summation, throughout the tutorial I learned about React concepts including elements, components, props, and state - as well as their corresponding functions and how to apply them.
